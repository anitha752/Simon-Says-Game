# Simon Says Game
Hey there! 
Welcome to my take on the classic Simon Says memory game — built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It’s a fun little game where the computer lights up a sequence of colored buttons, and your job is to repeat the exact sequence. Each level adds one more step — how far can you go before your memory gives up? 

## What’s Inside?
- A simple, clean UI with colorful buttons that respond with flashes.

- Keyboard support to kick things off.

- A dynamic level counter to track your progress.

- A Game Over screen with your score and an easy restart.

- Built completely from scratch using only basic web tech — no frameworks.

## How to Play
1. Open the page.

2. Press any key to start the game.

3. Watch closely as the game flashes one or more buttons.

4. Click the buttons in the exact same order.

5. With every correct level, the sequence gets longer. Miss a step? Game over!

6. Your score = the last level you cleared.

## Why I Made This
I built this game to sharpen my JavaScript skills, especially around DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with arrays. Plus, I wanted to create something fun and interactive that others could enjoy too!

## To Run This Locally
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anitha752/Simon-Says-Game.git
```
2. Open the folder and double-click index.html — that’s it! No need for any server or setup.

## Final Thoughts
This project was more than just a simple game — it was a hands-on journey into JavaScript and how fun and interactive code can be! I started with basic HTML and CSS, then gradually added the game logic using JavaScript. With each click and color flash, I understood a bit more about how web interactivity really works.

Creating the Simon Says Game helped me strengthen my fundamentals and boosted my confidence to build more exciting projects in the future. 

If you’re learning JavaScript or just looking for a fun weekend project, I’d definitely recommend trying something like this. Feel free to fork the repo, play around, or even improve the game!

Thanks for visiting my project — happy coding!
